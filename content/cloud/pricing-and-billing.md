## Fermyon Cloud Pricing
Fermyon Cloud offers subscription plans to help you increase the limits of your Fermyon Cloud usage. This page covers general information about subscription plans and answers frequently asked questions around [payment](#payment), [refunds](#refund), [support](#support), and [quota](#quota).

As described in detail on the [Fermyon Pricing page](fermyon.com/pricing), there are 3 different plans crafted to fit your workloads' requirements: Starter, Growth, and Enterprise. 

The Starter Plan provides a broad range of Fermyon Cloud services for you to try out, free of charger, forever. If you find that you're hitting the upper limits of the Starer Plan, we recommend promoting your account to the Growth Plan, where you can enjoy the same services with a higher quota limit. Lastly, if the serives offered don't quite meet your needs in the Growth Plan, [reach out](mailto:sales@fermyon.com) to the Fermyon team and we'll work to create a customized Enterprise Plan that will best meet your requirements. 

> Please note that Growth and Enterprise Plans are billed on a monthly reoccuring basis. Start Plan is a free subscription, without an expiration date. 

## General Information

### Payment

**I just signed up for the Growth Plan, when should I expect my first charge?**

You should receive your first charge immediately after signing up for the Growth Plan. You can expect your second charge on the monthly anniversary of your signup.

**What payment methods for you accept?**

Most. One of the main reasons we chose to work with industry leader Stripe is because of the huge scope of payment options they offer, starting with the normal credit / debit card options, but extending to ACH, SEPA, Apple Pay / Google Pay and many more including a larger variety of global options. For more details and a list to all Stripe payment options see this Stripe Resource. 

**Can I pay every month manually?**

No, at this time Fermyon Cloud only accepts reoccuring payments. If at any point you decide you no longer want to continue with your paid plan, you are eligable to cancel your subscription. 

**What happens if there's an issue with my payment method during a reoccuring charge?**

You will receive an email from Fermyon informing you that the payment method is invalid and requesting an updated, valid form of payment. If the payment method is not updated by the next billing date, your limits will be reverted to the Starter Subscription.

**How do I change my credit card used for billing by Fermyon Cloud?**
This can be done online on the [Fermyon Cloud Dashboard](cloud.fermyon.com) under _Account Settings --> Billing_. 


**How long is the Starter Plan available? Is there a time limit after which the free tier is unavailable to me?**

At this time the Starter Plan has no time limit. As long as your resource utilization remains below the monthly limits you can use Fermyon Cloud, for free, as long as you want it to. We reserve the right to change that policy, but for now we’re thrilled to be able to provide this service to you completely free.

### Invoice 

**Where can I see my bill?**

You can view all past invoices in the customer portal provided by Stripe. Please navigate to [Fermyon Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.fermyon.com) _—> Account settings —> Billing_.

**Can I see multiple past bills?**

Yes. You can view all past bills/invoices for your account in 
[Fermyon Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.fermyon.com) under _Account settings —> Billing_.

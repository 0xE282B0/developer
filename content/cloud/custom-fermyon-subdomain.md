- [Select Application]

Every Spin application running on Fermyon Cloud receives a domain name that has the following format: `<your-App-Name-randomlyAssignedString>.fermyon.app`. For a more easily recognizable domain name, you may want to change your Spin application's domain name from `slats-the-cat-o7jecuug.fermyon.app` to `slatsthecat.fermyon.app`. 

## Prerequisites

Log into [Fermyon Cloud](www.cloud.fermyon.com) and ensure you have an Spin application running on Fermyon Cloud. If you do not have a Spin application yet, follow our [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) to deploy one.

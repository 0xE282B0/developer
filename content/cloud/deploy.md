This document will guide you through deploying a Spin Application with the Fermyon Cloud. You can deploy your Spin App or Bartholomew site in just a few steps. 

## Setup

Firstly, you need to have the latest Spin Version installed and locally available in your path. You can do that by using this command in your terminal:
```
bash curl https://developer.fermyon.dev/downloads/install.sh | bash
```
## Login to the Fermyon Cloud

Next, you can Log in to the Fermyon Cloud, and it requires your GitHub account to sign in:
```
./spin login
```

This command generates an authentication code for your device to be authorized on the Fermyon Cloud. 

## Deployment

After building the project and testing it, the next thing to do is deployment. As mentioned above, you need to have the spin binary in your path. Now letâ€™s deploy.
```
./spin deploy
```

## Congratulations on Deploying your Spin Application! ðŸ¥³

You have now deployed your Spin Application to the Fermyon Cloud. You should also use these steps if you want to deploy a Bartholomew Site. It works just the same way. You should find something like this output after deploying your application:
```
curl -i <my url>
```

Next, weâ€™ll take a look at [search logs](/search-logs).

## Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages. It was recently ranked the most popular developer environment tool (by 82, 000 respondents in the [2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021)).

## Spin VS Code Extension

VS Code extensions allow you to add tools to your installation, to support your development workflow. Fermyon's [Spin VS Code Extension](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-vscode) integrates Spin developer tasks into the VS Code editor. For example, it allows you to build and test Spin components from within VS Code. In addition it provides a way for you to deploy/re-deploy your Spin applications directly into Fermyon Cloud; right from within the VS Code editor.

## Fermyon Cloud and VS Code

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyFSbf04yWY) shows you how to create, build, deploy, update and re-deploy a new Spin application, all from within VS Code. The video is based on using Fermyon Cloud to deploy your application and therefore also shows you how to log in to Fermyon Cloud from within VS Code.

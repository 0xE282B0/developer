## Installing the Spin CLI

Before developing a Spin application, you need to have the Spin CLI (the latest version) installed locally. Hereâ€™s a way to install the Spin CLI:

```
$ curl https://spin.fermyon.dev/downloads/install.sh | bash
```

You can verify the version of the CLI version installed by using this command:

```
$ spin --version
spin 0.5.0 (b9fedcc 2022-09-02)
```

### Next Step

The next step after installing the Spin CLI is creating your very first Spin application by going through and practicing what is in the [quickstart section of the Spin docs](https://spin.fermyon.dev/quickstart/).

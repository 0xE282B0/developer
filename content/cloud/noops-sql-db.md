With NoOps SQL Database using SQLite support in Fermyon Cloud, you can persist relational data generated by your [Spin](../spin/install.md) application in between application invocations without worrying about database management. Fermyon Cloud will provision and manage the database on your behalf:, no operations (NoOps) are required. Fermyon Cloud will do the heavy lifting for you. To learn more about the Spin SQLite SDK, please visit the [API guide](../spin/sqlite-api-guide.md).

## Accessing Private Beta

The database in Fermyon Cloud is currently in private beta. To request access to the private beta, please fill out this short [sign-up form](https://fibsu0jcu2g.typeform.com/to/Brv12FI0#hubspot_utk=xxxxx&hubspot_page_name=xxxxx&hubspot_page_url=xxxxx).
 
> Please note that the private beta is limited in space, and all requests cannot be guaranteed. 

Once you have access to the private beta, please ensure you have [Spin CLI](./cli-reference.md) v1.4 or greater, and [`cloud` plugin](https://github.com/fermyon/cloud-plugin) v0.1.2 or greater installed. 

## Quotas And Service Limitations For the Database in Fermyon Cloud

*Quotas* 
* You can have a maximum of 1 NoOps SQL Database in your Cloud account
* Your NoOps SQL Database can hold up 1 GB of data

*Service Limitations*
* The `--sqlite` flag is not supported on `spin cloud deploy`
* Fermyon **Cloud** only supports databases named "default" at this time

## Creating a New Spin Application

If you already have a Spin application, you can skip this step. If you do not have a Spin application locally you will need to [create one](/spin/quickstart#create-your-first-application).

## Grant SQLite Permission

To tell Spin that we want to use SQLite storage, we only need to [grant SQLite permission to a component in the applicationâ€™s manifest](/spin/sqlite-api-guide#granting-sqlite-database-permissions-to-components) (the `spin.toml` file). For example:

```
[component]
sqlite_databases = ["default"]
```

The new database file (`sqlite_db.db`) is created in your application's `.spin` folder when you deploy this Spin application. The database persists across Spin application invocations and updates. The database is empty and can optionally have tables and data added using the following step.

## Tables and Data Locally (Optional)

See [preparing an SQLite database](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/sqlite-api-guide#preparing-an-sqlite-database) for more information on using the `spin up` subcommand's `--sqlite` option to create and populate tables locally. No **Cloud** database is created or changed as a result of using this this optional `spin up --sqlite` example. Populating this local database can be useful for testing (the relationship between your application's logic and your schema) before deploying your application to Fermyon Cloud.

## Tables and Data in Fermyon Cloud

When you first `spin cloud deploy` your application (with the `sqlite_databases` configuration, as shown above), Fermyon Cloud will create a new & empty database for your Cloud application. This new Cloud database will have a unique name. To obtain the name, type the following command in your local NoOps SQLite application's directory:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite list
Databases (1)
inspirational-pig (default)
```

Then use the `spin cloud sqlite execute` command to create your Cloud database's schema i.e. execute language syntax compatible with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) against your Cloud database.

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite execute inspirational-pig "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,description TEXT NOT NULL,due_date DATE,starred BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0)"
```

> Note: Cloud database is completely unrelated to the local (optional) database.

## Deleting the Cloud Database

Warning: using the `delete` subcommand is **permanent**. 

You can delete your default database with the following command:

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite delete inspirational-pig
The action is irreversible.
Please type "inspirational-pig" for confirmation: inspirational-pig
Deleting database ...
Database "inspirational-pig" deleted
```

> In the Private Beta, the database is inaccessible once the application has been deleted. However, we separate out the database deletion step because we anticipate the database being accessible after deletion in a future beta. We enforce database deletion to prevent unintentional data sharing between Spin applications. 

## FAQ

- **Can I export data from my database?**
At this time, Fermyon Cloud does not have a data export feature. We'd love to hear your thoughts on what an ideal experience would look like at [github.com/fermyon/feedback](https://github.com/fermyon/feedback)

- **If I upgrade my Spin application, can I still access the same instance of my database?**
Yes, as long as you haven't deleted your database, the instance will be running and stateful. 

- **If I delete and redeploy my Spin application, can I still access the same instance of my database?**
No, at this time you cannot access the database. You will need to delete the instance and provision a new one.

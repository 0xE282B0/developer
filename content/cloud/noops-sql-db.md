With NoOps SQL Database using SQLite support in Fermyon Cloud, you can persist relational data generated by your [Spin](../spin/install.md) application in between application invocations without worrying about database management. Fermyon Cloud will provision and manage the database on your behalf; no operations (NoOps) are required. Fermyon Cloud will do the heavy lifting for you. To learn more about the Spin SQLite SDK, please visit the [API guide](../spin/sqlite-api-guide.md).

## Accessing Private Beta

The database in Fermyon Cloud is currently in private beta. To request access to the private beta, please fill out this short [sign-up form](https://fibsu0jcu2g.typeform.com/to/Brv12FI0#hubspot_utk=xxxxx&hubspot_page_name=xxxxx&hubspot_page_url=xxxxx).
 
> Please note that the private beta is limited in space, and all requests cannot be guaranteed. 

Once you have access to the private beta, please ensure you have [Spin CLI](./cli-reference.md) v1.4 or greater, and [`cloud` plugin](https://github.com/fermyon/cloud-plugin) v0.1.2 or greater installed. 

## Quotas And Service Limitations For the Database in Fermyon Cloud

*Quotas* 
* You can have a maximum of 1 NoOps SQL Database in your Cloud account
* Your NoOps SQL Database can hold up 1 GB of data

*Service Limitations*
* The `--sqlite` flag is not supported on `spin cloud deploy`
* Fermyon **Cloud** only supports databases named "default" at this time

## How To

Firstly, if you have not already done so, you will need to [create your first Spin application](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/quickstart#create-your-first-application). Our blog posts [Announcing Fermyon Cloud’s NoOps SQL Database](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/announcing-noops-sql-db) and [NoOps and Serverless Are the Perfect Pair](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/noops-and-serverless-are-the-perfect-pair) each have an example of how to create a NoOps SQLite Storage application. To tell Spin that we want to use SQLite storage, we only need to [grant SQLite permission to a component in the application’s manifest]((https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/sqlite-api-guide#granting-sqlite-database-permissions-to-components)) (the spin.toml file). For example:

```
[component]
sqlite_databases = ["default"]
```

### Database Access From Many Components

A database is created when you build a Spin application referencing a "default" SQLite database in the component section of an application's manifest. Multiple components in the same Spin application can be given access to the same `default` database like so:

```toml
# c1 does not have access to the default database
[component]
name = "c1"

# c2 can use the default database
[component]
name = "c2"
sqlite_databases = ["default"]

# c3 can use default database as well
[component]
name = "c3"
sqlite_databases = ["default"]
```

The above configuration will last the lifespan of the application.

### Preparing Fermyon Cloud Schema

Bootstrapping your Cloud SQLite database schema is done via the `spin cloud sqlite execute` subcommand. Your NoOps SQLite application on localhost will have already assigned a name for your database. All we need to do is obtain the name by typing the following command (in your local NoOps SQLite application's directory):

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite list
Databases (1)
inspirational-pig (default)
```

Once we have this name (in this above example, we can see our database called `inspirational-pig`), we use that `inspirational-pig` as part of our `spin cloud sqlite execute` subcommand to create our schema for our Fermyon Cloud application:

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite execute inspirational-pig "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,description TEXT NOT NULL,due_date DATE,starred BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0)"
```

As mentioned above, Fermyon Cloud only supports databases named “default” at this time. Once you add the `sqlite_databases = ["default"]` line to your local Spin application's manifest, Spin internally associates that `default` database with the random name Spin autogenerates, i.e. `inspirational-pig`. The name is not arbitrary and must be used explicitly when using the `spin cloud sqlite execute` subcommand (as shown above). This will allow you to develop your application, continually build locally, and deploy to Fermyon Cloud, knowing that the two instances (localhost and Cloud) share the same schema.

### Deleting the Database

Lastly, (warning; using the `delete` subcommand is **permanent**) you can delete your default database with the following command:

```bash
$ spin cloud sqlite delete inspirational-pig
The action is irreversible.
Please type "inspirational-pig" for confirmation: inspirational-pig
Deleting database ...
Database "inspirational-pig" deleted
```

> In the Private Beta, the database is inaccessible once the application has been deleted. However, we separate out the database deletion step because we anticipate the database being accessible after deletion in a future beta. We enforce database deletion to prevent unintentional data sharing between Spin applications. 

## FAQ

- **Can I export data from my database?**
At this time, Fermyon Cloud does not have a data export feature. We'd love to hear your thoughts on what an ideal experience would look like at [github.com/fermyon/feedback](https://github.com/fermyon/feedback)

- **If I upgrade my Spin application, can I still access the same instance of my database?**
Yes, as long as you haven't deleted your database, the instance will be running and stateful. 

- **If I delete and redeploy my Spin application, can I still access the same instance of my database?**
No, at this time you cannot access the database. You will need to delete the instance and provision a new one.

## Fermyon Cloud User Settings

User settings empower you to take control of your Fermyon Cloud experience. Today, you can complete the following actions on user setting: create and manage a Personal Access Token (PAT); delete your Fermyon Cloud account. Follow the relevant sections for your use case below to learn how to complete both of these actions. 

## Create And Manage A Personal Access Token (PAT)

### Create A PAT
To deploy your Spin applications in a streamlined manner, you may want to create a PAT to use with a continuous integration pipeline such as GitHub Actions. Let's walk through the steps required to create a PAT.

First [log into the Cloud](/quickstart.md#log-in-to-the-fermyon-cloud). Then hover on your username in the top right corner and select the 'User Settings' from the down options:

Now select the "Add a token" button under the Personal Access Tokens heading.

Input your preferred token name. We recommend that you use a  descriptive name to help you can recall its purpose later.

Take a moment to copy your token name and store it in a safe location for later.

Exit out of the panel. Congratulations on creating your first PAT with Fermyon Cloud.

### Delete A PAT
To delete a PAT, click on the `x` to the right of the desired token name. This will bring up the following prompt:

![Delete token confirmation](/static/image/delete-token-confirmation.png)

Type out the complete token name and hit delete to permanently delete your PAT.

You should no longer see the PAT in your User Settings view.

## Delete Your Fermyon Cloud Account
You may wish to delete your Fermyon Cloud account. This is a permanent action that will delete your account along with any running applications associated with the account at that time.

First [log into the Cloud](/quickstart.md#log-in-to-the-fermyon-cloud). Then hover on your username in the top right corner and select the 'User Settings' from the down options:

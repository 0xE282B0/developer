It’s super easy to delete your application with Fermyon Cloud. This can be done in just a few steps after seeing your Fermyon Cloud dashboard.

Click on the application on the dashboard.

Once you do that, a panel pops out from the right side just like this:

In the section above, you get to see the logs, a link that can help navigate to your deployed application, and then a delete icon in the top right corner of the dashboard page, just like you can see in the image above. 

After clicking the button, you’ll see a popup for verification of the application’s deletion. In this case, you need to type the application’s name in the input form and delete it successfully.

That’s all about deleting your Spin Application on the Fermyon Cloud!

Once you do that, a panel pops out from the right side just like this:

In the section above, you get to see the logs, a link that can help navigate to your deployed application, and then a delete icon in the top right corner of the dashboard page, just like you can see in the image above. 

After clicking the button, you’ll see a popup for verification of the application’s deletion. In this case, you need to type the application’s name in the input form and delete it successfully.

With SQLite support in Fermyon Cloud, you can persist relational data generated by your Spin application in between application invocations without having to worry about database management. Fermyon Cloud will provision and manage the database on your behalf. To learn more about the Spin SQLite SDK, please visit the [API guide](../spin/sqlite-api-guide.md).

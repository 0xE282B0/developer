## Managing Templates

Spin templates are designed to allow application developers to create the skeleton of an application or component via the `spin` command. You can start learning about how to manage Spin templates by reading [the template section](/common/cli-reference#templates) of the Spin Command Line Interface (CLI) documentation. If you are interested, there is documentation about [creating Spin templates](/spin/template-authoring) for advanced users and alternate use cases. For now, let’s focus on managing and using Spin’s existing templates.

### Housekeeping

Please go ahead and [install](/spin/install) (or update) Spin. The Spin version information is available via the following command:

<!-- @selectiveCpy -->

```bash
$ spin --version
```

## Built With Spin

Spin can be used to build many different types of applications. The following blog articles show how different applications are built with Spin:

[How I Built a Like Button for My Blog with Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/how-i-built-a-like-button-for-my-blog-with-spin)

The 'Building a Social App with Spin' series covers the process and decision-making of building an authenticated, dynamic, database-backed application and API, right the way from downloading Spin and setting up the project to deploying the finished application to the cloud.

The 'Finicky Whiskers' series covers the journey of creating a game with an architecture designed to [re-think microservices](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/rethinking-microservices) and showcase how WebAssembly modules can be started, executed, and shut down in the blink of an eye.

> Finicky Whiskers was built to be the world's most adorable manual load generator, so it's not necessarily an model of how to use Spin most efficiently! But the series may be useful for decomposing an application into Spin microservices, and as a look at how Spin and containers can work together. As a bonus, if you are interested, you can play the game [here](https://www.finickywhiskers.com/index.html).

## Next Steps

- Try [running your application locally](running-apps)
- Learn about how to [configure your application at runtime](dynamic-configuration)
- Look up details in the [application manifest reference](manifest-reference)
- Try deploying a Spin application to the [Fermyon Cloud](/cloud/quickstart)
